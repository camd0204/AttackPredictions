# AttackPredictions
## Network Attack Predictions with different ML algorithms

A project for my networking I class consisting of trying to predict network attacks through 3 different ML algorithms: Logistical Regression (Classification), Neural Network and Neural Network with LTSM layer. The metrics given are the accuracy and recall where all of the 3 models score above or equals to the 90%. The preprocessing is also done in the notebook. The dataset used is the UNSW-NB15 packet flow dataset. The google drive imports and dataset path should be changed in order for the notebook to work.
